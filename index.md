Welcome to the BERNADETTE project website! Feel free to bookmark this to keep an eye on the project updates.

## About the project

The objective of this Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action (MSCA) is to develop novel statistical methodology for the modeling 
of infectious diseases like COVID-19. The success of the interdisciplinary project will lead to a number of multidisciplinary
innovations in epidemiology, Public Health policy and statistics, which will contribute to the timely identification of optimal
disease control strategies. 

The BERNADETTE outputs will be relevant to healthcare and the EU Epidemic intelligence, by: 
1. Offering novel statistical methodology for the analysis of COVID-19 outbreak data and the description of a number of aspects of the underlying infection pathway of the disease
2. Quantifying the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions based on an epidemic model
3. Allowing for the forecasting of future case number scenarios
4. Contributing in the assessment of the socio-economic impact of different response strategies for human epidemics in Europe in order to improve European preparedness planning and support decision-making in the framework of national epidemic preparedness plans. 
The BERNADETTE outputs will contribute to the enhancement of EU scientific excellence.

Inspired by the findings of this MSCA and striving to maximise the impact of the research outcomes, we are planning to organise public engagement activities and to publish papers in highly ranked peer-review journals that will benefit epidemiologists, Public Health policy makers and statisticians.
